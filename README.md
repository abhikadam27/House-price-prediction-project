# House Price Prediction with Data Analysis

In this project, we aimed to predict house prices and perform extensive data analysis. The dataset consisted of various features related to houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors. However, the dataset had missing values and outliers that needed to be addressed before building a predictive model.

To treat missing values, we employed appropriate techniques such as mean or median imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features. We ensured that the missing values were filled adequately to maintain data integrity and minimize bias in subsequent analyses.

Regarding outlier treatment, we replaced outliers with percentile approach. Outliers were either removed or adjusted to more representative values to prevent them from adversely influencing our predictive model.

we performed extensive data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on house prices. Visualizations, such as scatter plots, box plots, and histograms, were employed to highlight trends, patterns, and distributions within the data.

Furthermore, we conducted feature engineering to extract valuable information from existing features and create new relevant ones. This process involved transformations, scaling, and encoding categorical variables to enhance the predictive power of our model.

Finally, we built a house price prediction model using advanced regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble models like random forests. We evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the predictions.

Overall, this project aimed to predict house prices for a portfolio by treating missing values, handling outliers, and conducting extensive data analysis. The results provide valuable insights and a reliable predictive model that can assist in making informed decisions regarding the portfolio's housing investments.
